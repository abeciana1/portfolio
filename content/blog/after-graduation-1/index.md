description: A slight departure from the usual programming but necessary.

_Since graduating from Flatiron School in late October 2020, I have gone through different refactors of my weekly schedule, bought various courses on Udemy, and tried to research the best, free options to expanding on my technical education. So I felt that I should write this kind of a post to tell you what I learned about productivity and the new strategy that I'm doing now to help someone in similar shoes._

_I wanted to make this blog post interactive with opportunities for you, the reader, to answer personal questions for yourself to create your own productivity strategy._

# It's the journey, not the destination

## Avoid the Burnout

I remember the Monday after graduating and attempting to start learning the same way I did every day for the previous three and a half months.

**üí°Tip #1** ‚Äî Give yourself sometime to recharge. It's not a race!

I didn't realize it but the program had burnt me out tremendously and then I took the next week off completely.

Yes, you need to plan a schedule, but it needs to be a schedule that you can commit to. You have to be honest with yourself and know your own work ethic.

Personally, I'm the type of person who can't sleep well if I have outstanding questions and research that needs to be done. Therefore, I now space out my days more so that if I come across something that peaks that side of me, I can spend 4 hours or more researching the topic and learning why it works the way it does without the guilt of not completing everything on my to-do list.

‚ùì**Question #1 ‚Äî _Being honest with yourself ‚Äî What is your work ethic? How long can you stay focused?_**

## Creating Your Schedule

Based on your answer for the previous section's question, this section will be short and you can answer the question easily.

Creating your schedule depends on how you learn, your work ethic, and your ability to stay focused and distraction-free during the day.

**üí°Tip #2** ‚Äî Always schedule in breaks.

After graduating from the bootcamp and after some refactors since then, my strategy was centered around learning a little bit each day. I would start my morning with breakfast and watching a Udemy course on data structures and algorithms. (Yeah, I hate them, you hate them, and loads of Senior Devs hate them ... but for some reason, it's still a common practice to hire via whiteboarding problems.) The early afternoon consisted of lunch and learning Redux (or at least it was at the time / learn any topic that peak your interest) for two and half hours. Late afternoon to about early evening (around 3:30 to 6 pm), I was learning another topic or doing research or taking another video course, like the UX design one I did in the winter. The evening was pretty easy, dinner and work on a project.

At a glance, this schedule might seem nice and well-balanced and it was, until I hit road blocks in your learning where things take extra time. For example, let's say you're doing algorithm practice and can't solve a hard problem, do you give up and comeback tomorrow or do you want to struggle more and attempt to solve it the same day?

There's no right or wrong answer. I would hit similar roadblocks and struggle so my schedule would be backed up and I would feel guilty about being behind on my progress or lack thereof.

These days I have balanced out my schedule more. I go for a nickel-and-dime approach and doing a little bit each day. My daily to-do list looks something like this:

- Network and contact at least two people
- Try to apply to two jobs
- Work on a project piece-by-piece throughout the day
- Weekly - Learn something new
- Weekly - Learn a data structure or algorithm (this is new because I just started learning these again.)

My day is structured and spaced out. I don't feel overwhelmed and I can see my progress my focusing on new topics each week and practicing with them by building them into projects.

‚ùì**Question #2 ‚Äî _How do you learn?_**

# Conclusion

I decided to break this up into separate parts so that you can first work on a schedule the strategy that works for you.

Next week's post will be about the job search!

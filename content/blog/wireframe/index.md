<h1>Wireframing Crash Course: Tips and Resources</h1>

Whether you're teaching yourself to software engineering or you're currently attending a coding bootcamp, there comes a time when you need to create a website. Having a detailed plan of how you plan to structure information, pages, and features is essential to displaying critical thinking of user experience and alleviating heartache in the future.

<h2>What wireframing is</h2>

Wireframing is the simple, bare-bones rendering of what your potential website may be. Here, you can plan the layout and the placement of user interface elements.

<h2>What wireframing is not</h2>

Wireframing is not the final product in the UX/UI design journey. There is no need to worry about which specific images to use, the copy that should be written, fonts, animation, or any other granular details that is still part of the product development roadmap.

You’re not expected to create custom art for a wireframe. In fact, many wireframes start with a pencil and paper or a whiteboard. Using a wireframing software can help but isn’t necessary since wireframing is even more temporary and in a status of consistent altering in the early days of product planning.

<h2>Tips</h2>

<h3>Keep It Simple</h3>

As mentioned above, you’re not supposed to have your expert copywriting skills or any images on display. Fill in text areas with curvy lines or use a <a href="https://loremipsum.io/" alt="Lorem Ipsum Generator" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum generator</a> if you’re using a computer.

Your wireframe’s aesthetic design shouldn’t be the only thing kept simple. The user flow should as well. If you can’t explain a simpler site mapping solution to someone without them feeling confused, then your site is too complicated. In a world that revolves on speed readily available information, a complicated path won’t do well for the future of your product.

<h3>Homework</h3>

In another <a href="/Mod2_UX" alt="Flatiron School Mod 2 UX Design Crash Course" target="_blank">blog post</a> of mine, I discussed the need to do user experience research in order to successfully go through the design thinking process and create a solution to a problem.

This user experience research plays a major role in how your information is structured and where certain areas of the page may need to be located.

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

Unfortunately, UX design is not a science. It’s heavily opinionated and no single person has the right answer. Collaboration invites alternative solutions and ideas that can improve the outcome.
